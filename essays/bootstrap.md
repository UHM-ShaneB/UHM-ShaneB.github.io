## The beginning of web design

I’ve been wanting to learn about html and css but I never had the motivation to learn it on my own. But now I am learning it and so far it’s not too bad. Html was probably the harder one to understand since it uses keywords and syntax that I have never seen in other coding languages before. Though I guess that’s why there are memes in the programming community suggesting that html is not a coding language. Coding language or not, I still want to learn html.

It’s pretty much a library to help you with the design of your website.. However, learning bootstrap is no different than learning another language. There were a lot of classes to remember and, to be honest, I don’t remember most of the ones I used.

### So why use bootstrap

Using bootstrap will make your life easier if you know what to do. The amount of time it takes to style your website will be significantly reduced with bootstrap. All you need to do is implement the classes and that’s pretty much it. It does have its limitations though. If you want to use a specific font or color, then you would have to specify it in your style.css file.
