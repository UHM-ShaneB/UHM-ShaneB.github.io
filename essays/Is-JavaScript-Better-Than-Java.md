## A new experience

Before I started learning about JavaScript the only other programming language I knew was Java. So learning the basics of JavaScript wasn’t too difficult. There was a lot to remember but thankfully a lot of the syntax was very similar to Java like if-else and loops. They do have their differences but do those differences make JavaScript better than Java?

## Java is too complicated

In my opinion, JavaScript makes things less complicated compared to Java. For example, in Java, declaring variables requires certain keywords depending on the type of information you want to store, and there are many different types. If you want to store a whole number in the variable you would need to use the keyword called int. If you try putting anything else in an int variable, you will get an error. However, in javaScript it doesn’t use any of those keywords. The only keywords you need are var, let, or const. These keywords have different uses but they all can store data of any type.

## JavasScript isn't strict

When I code using Java, it feels too strict. When you create functions or methods you have to define the return type and it must return a value of that type. So if your function returns a boolean, it has to be true or false, you can’t return a number or a string. JavaScript on the other hand does not care what you return.

## Thoughts on JavaScript

I am still in the early stages of learning JavaScript but so far I can say that my experience with this new language is great. I can even say that it is looking a lot better than Java and make the switch to JavaScript as my maing coding language because I believe I can create much more intricate projects.
