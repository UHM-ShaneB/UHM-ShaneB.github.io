## A new experience

Before I started learning about JavaScript the only other programming language I knew was Java. So learning the basics of JavaScript wasn’t too difficult. There was a lot to remember but thankfully a lot of the syntax was very similar to Java like if-else and loops. They do have their differences but do those differences make JavaScript better than Java?

## Java is too complicated

In my opinion, JavaScript makes things less complicated compared to Java especially when it comes to functions, or methods. When you create functions in Java you have to define the return type and it must return a value of that type. So if your function returns a boolean, it has to be true or false, you can’t return a number or a string. Functions in JavaScript on the other hand does not care what datatype you return because you don't specify what the return is. There are other keywords in Java that you can use like private, public, static, and nonstatic which can be very useful but to someone who just started learning Java, that can be very confusing.

## The cons of JavaScript

I mentioned quite a few things that makes Javascript better than Java. However, that does not mean it is a perfect coding language. I have my problems as well but they may not be so bad. One thing I noticed is that JavaScript error messages do not provide much help. I had an error saying that I can't access a certain property but it wasn't because I mispelled the property name or the name of the object. Instead, the problem occured because I mispelled constructor when I made the class. It doesn't even tell me the line that the error occurse, or at least it's not obvious for me to see. Java, however, tells you the line the error occured and the type of error. Though sometimes it can be a bit confusing with the name they used. This may just be an IDE problem though. I haven't tried using any other IDE for JavaScript so I won't be too harsh about it for now.

## Thoughts on JavaScript

I am still in the early stages of learning JavaScript but so far I can say that my experience with this new language is great. Even if I way the pros and cons of JavaScript, it still seems a lot better than Java. I may in fact make the switch to JavaScript as my main coding language because I believe I can create much more intricate projects.
