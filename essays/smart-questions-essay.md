## What is a smart question?

The difference between a smart question and a dumb question is the way they are worded. You will get a different response if you ask a smart question versus if you were to ask a dumb one and it's obvious that asking the dumb question will result in recieving bad or unhelpful advice. To ask a smart question, you need to keep in mind the audience you are asking the question to. Make sure it is relevent to the platform you are asking the question and provide necessary details to support your question. For eaxample, if you are having problems with your code explain what the problem is and if it occurs when you do something specific. Though before you ask your smart question, try to figure out the solutuion yourself first or even search for similar problems on the internet. Smart questions are more like your last resort.

## Importance of smart questions

For software engineers who are unsure of what to do, asking smart questions leads to the solution they need much more effciently compared to asking a question that is not so smart. Smart questions can affect the type of response you'll get from the person reading it. If you provide them with a lot of information and what you did to try and solve the problem yourself, they can use it to come up with a different and, most likely, an accurate solution. If you don't provide much details in your question, you most likely won't get a proper solution, and those who have a solution may just ignore it. Which means you won't be able to progress any further. Also, when you are in the process of preparing a smart question, you might end up figuring out the solution to your problem and not need to ask the question.

## Smart question example

I found a person on stackoverflow who had a problem with starting up an IDE called Eclipse. This person asked for assisstance in a smart way. They provided the version of Eclipse they installed, the error message, and even mentioned that they tried to do something to fix the problem before resorting to asking the community for help. This person got a very postive response from the community. One person gave an explanation as to why it wasn't working along with a detailed explanation on how to fix the problem. The post can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11461607/cant-start-eclipse-java-was-started-but-returned-exit-code-13) on stackoverflow.

## A question that is not so smart

An example of a not so smart question can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18040762/length-java15-error-cannot-find-symbol-length-java16-error-cannot-find-sy) on stackoverflow. Basically this person asking the question did not provide enough information. They stated that they are getting "cannot find symbol" errors in his Java program and posted pictures of his code with nothing else to support. It didn't seem like this person even tried to fix the problem on his own because they never stated if they tried anything to diagnose the problem. They didn't even ask for any advice or help on how to fix it and the code they posted was also hard to read because it lacked indentation. This person received a lot of negative responses but some of them still provide a fix for this persons problem.
