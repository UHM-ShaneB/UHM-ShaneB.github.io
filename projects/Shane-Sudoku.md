This was another project that I did using Java. This was also a solo project so all the code was written by me. It's not perfect; there is still a lot of bugs.

This sudoku game has four difficulties the player can choose which pretty much determines how many given numbers there are. When you complete a sudoku puzzle you get congratulated which I believe just prints congratulations in the console. It's still a WIP build.
