## About the Project

The objective of this project was to design a functioning calculator app, making use of the GUI elements provided by the swing package from the javax libraries. I wanted the calculator to function the way most basic calculators do. This calculator allows the user to click on buttons to perform basic operations - add, subtract, multiply, and divide - and displays the results to the user. Users can also use the previous results as an entry to a new equation by clicking on one ofn the operation buttons. 

## My Contribution

I created this project by myself and it was the first Java project I did outside of a class setting. I had some help from watching some YouTube videos but I didn't copy and paste the code they used, just referenced certain parts. I wanted to write it the way I imagined so the size of each GUI element - frame, buttons, and panels - were specified by me. The positons of each button and panels were also adjusted to my liking, and the colors were also chosen by me.

Through this experience I learned the basics of creating GUIs as well as importing from different libraries since this project did use functions from the javax.swing library.
