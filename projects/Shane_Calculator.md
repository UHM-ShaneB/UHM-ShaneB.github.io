## About the Project

The objective of this project was to design a functioning calculator app, making use of the GUI elements provided by the swing package from the javax libraries. I wanted the calculator to function the way most basic calculators do. This calculator allows the user to click on buttons to perform basic operations - add, subtract, multiply, and divide - and displays the results to the user. Users can also use the previous results as an entry to a new equation by clicking on one ofn the operation buttons. 

## My Contribution

I created this project by myself and it was the first Java project I did outside of a class setting. I had some help from watching some YouTube videos but I didn't copy and paste the code they used, just referenced certain parts. I wanted to write it the way I imagined so the size of each GUI element - frame, buttons, and panels - were specified by me. The positons of each button and panels were also adjusted to my liking, and the colors were also chosen by me. It's currently a work in progress, though I'm not too sure if I will continue it. I may want to scrap this project and create a new calculator app, probably utilizing a different language like JavaScript.

## The knowledge I have gained

Through this experience I learned a lot more features that Java provides as well as expanded my knowledge of certain features. One thing I learned was the basics of creating GUIs which was how to generate a frame, buttons, and panels and manipulate them to create an interactive window for the user. I learned about the extends keyword which allows you to create your own class that inherits the attributes from the extended class which is called the parent class.
