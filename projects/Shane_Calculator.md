summary: "An interactive calculator app that does basic operations"
---

This is a calculator app I created using Java. All it can do is the basic operations add, subtract, multiply and divide. This project was a way for me to practice making a graphical user interface (GUI). This was a solo project so all the code was written by me. It is still a WIP build. As you can see in one of the files I wrote comments of what needed to be fixed and added.
