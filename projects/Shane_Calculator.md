summary: "An interactive calculator app that does basic operations"
---

This project was to create a calculator application using Java. It can do the basic operations so add, subtract, multiply and divide.

This was a solo project so I wrote all the code. It was not a part of any assignment that I had to do for anyone. It was just something I made on my freetime in order to make use of what I learned. This is still a WIP build. As you can see in one of the files I have commented some known bugs I needed to fix and other features I want to add.
