## Aboout the Project

The objective of this project was to design a funtioning calculator app, making use of the GUI elements provided by the swing package from the javax libraries. I wanted the calculator to function the way most basic calculators do. This calculator allows the user to click on buttons to perform basic operations - add, subtract, multiply, and divide - and displays the results to the user. Users can also use the previous results as an entry to a new equation by clicking on one ofn the operation buttons. 

This was a solo project so I wrote all the code. It was not a part of any assignment that I had to do for anyone. It was just something I made on my freetime in order to make use of what I learned. This is still a WIP build. As you can see in one of the files I have commented some known bugs I needed to fix and other features I want to add.

Through this experience I learned the basics of creating GUIs as well as importing from different libraries since this project did use functions from the javax.swing library.
