## About the Project

The idea of this project is to create a web application for people that frequent, or plan on frequenting, the Rec Center at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa campus. There are many people that workout by themselves, but working out by yourself is both boring and unsafe. So our organization, [Syntax-Souljahs](https://syntax-souljahs.github.io/), has decided to develop a website for those people to find someone to buddy up with.

## Contributors

Excluding myself, the organization consisted of 5 other individuals: [Ronan Russel Andal](https://github.com/RonanAndal), [Alvin Wu](https://github.com/wualvin2021), [Isai Foglesong](https://github.com/isai-foglesong), [Hunter Von Tungeln](https://github.com/HunterVT), and [Tyler Mak](https://github.com/tylermak16).
