I created these pixel are characters for a 2D game that I tried making in Java. I never got to finish making the game but I still have the artwork I made. These were all done on gimp which is pretty much a free version of photoshop.

I had only designed two different entities, the player and an npc that I designated as the mayor. However, I did create multiple different sprites for each of the two in order to animate their movement. I had created 12 for the mayor and 14 for the player.

Below our a few sprites that I made.

<div class="text-center p-4">
  <img width="200px" src="../img/Entity/Chibi_Down_1_200.png" class="img-thumbnail" >
  <img width="200px" src="../img/Entity/Chibi_Left_1_200.png" class="img-thumbnail" >
  <img width="200px" src="../img/Entity/Chibi_Up_1_200.png" class="img-thumbnail" >
</div>

</div>
