summary: "Pixel art of video game entities"
---

I created these pixel are characters for a 2D game that I tried making in Java. I never got to finish making the game but I still have the artwork I made. These were all done on gimp which is pretty much a free version of photoshop.

All of these images were created by me but i did reference some images from games that also uses pixel are. One of which was stardew valley.I had only designed two different entities, the player and an npc that I designated as the mayor. However, I did create multiple different sprites for each of the two in order to animate their movement. I had created 12 for the mayor and 14 for the player.

From this project I learned the syntax to path items from a file in Java. Though I only know what the syntax is but not what each term meant. i still need to figure that one out.

Below our a few sprites that I made for the player (Top) and the mayor (Bottom). These are scaled to larger a size in order to see the individual pixels. I think the actual size is around 32x48 pixels so it's really small to see.
